# layerless_fnn

To understand what I'm trying to do see [my article on researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374025541_Layerless_Feedforward_Neural_Networks_with_Automatic_Architecture_Optimization)

Compile with 
'nvcc -O3 main.cu'
works for me on Linux with RTX2070S

Need to add [this folder](https://github.com/wichtounet/mnist/tree/master) if you want to train on MNIST
